# The problem

Some keyboards have lots of keys, and some people are used to typing on keyboards with many keys. However, we don't need that many keys. We can have fewer than 40 keys and still have the same functionalities. We can have different modes, and according to those modes, our keys will have different actions. We can achieve this by using xremap and mapping everything near the home row. Now, if we map everything near the home row using xremap, it can be hard for a newbie to recall which key is mapped to which key. This is the problem that this project is solving. It will open a floating window if configured to open a floating window in certain modes and will show which key is mapped to which key.

This project is currently in its initial stage and is not yet usable for normal users. I'll be updating this project periodically and addressing any issues that arise while I'm using it.
